# Bayesian optimization of the PC algorithm

These experiments are computationally intensive.

### Contents
- `paper_results`: experiment results for the figures in the paper.
- `exp_templates`: templates for Spearmint (automatically read by `launcher.sh`)
- Scripts for launching the experiments (`data_sim.R` and `launcher.sh`) and plotting the results (`plot_*.R`).

### Requirements
- R packages: `bnlearn`, `pcalg`, `Rserve`
- Python packages: `pyRserve`, `matplotlib`
- [Spearmint](https://github.com/EduardoGarrido90/Spearmint) with PESMOC.
